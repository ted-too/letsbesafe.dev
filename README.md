letsbesafe is a collection of safe and privacy focused apps that you may use in your everyday life

## Why
To be honest I got really tired and frustrated with using apps that would track you, were low quality, barely functioning and bloated with ads, and you know what they say if you want something done right do it yourself.
I started with `Jameela` a youtube video downloader as a proof of concept and now hopefully there's more to come.    

If you take your online privacy seriously I recommend going through the [`Awesome-Privacy`](https://github.com/pluja/awesome-privacy) repo, they're some more really good alternatives to apps that you'd usually use on a day to day basis.

## Apps

- `jameela`: a barebones youtube video downloader
- `kawan`: a simple debloated torrent search engine
